# nornir-network-automation
Project used to develop Use Case for Network Automation.

# IMPORTANT

Project is being redisigned to use Python as the main service provider and rollback executor.
I'll continue to use nornir as my inventory handler. But now the services will be divided into config files instead of scripts.
All the old project is moving to a folder named 'old' and it will mainly be used for consulting.
